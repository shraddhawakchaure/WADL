      When I was a child I thought I saw an angel. It had wings and kinda looked
      like my sister. I opened the door so some light could come into the room,
      and it sort of faded away. My mother said it was probably my Guardian
      Angel.

      Without commitment, you’ll never start, but more importantly, without
      consistency, you’ll never finish.
