      &nbsp;Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
      storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
      the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
      the appearance of the document.

      &nbsp;HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
      constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be
      embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
      structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
      headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements
      are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
